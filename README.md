# [SPDX] Industries of Enceladus

## Features
### Changes
 - Adds four docking bays to the OCP-209 (extends to the DD variant)

### Ships
 - SSE Cothon-2200-XL: expands crew space to 6, increases flight comfort, adds a set of left-right translatory thrusters and optimises the manual firing binds
 - MAD-CERF (Civilian Refit): 8 crew, lots of fun hardpoints and tons of hold space but no pod mounts, relies on onboard capacity to get things done
 - OCP-214-DD: expands the cargo bay forward, reducing mineral hold space but supports cargo bay accessories, is a bit awkward to handle as a result
 - OCP-207-SNAP: adds a unique Pacman-style jaw excavator to the 209 and has some funny sound effects, no autopilot assist
 - Tsukuyomi-class Frigate (Decommissioned): has a ton of hardpoints, torch RCS, and is very heavy. technically demilitarised but you can totally make it into a horrific murder machine
 - UMC Oberon MLP-60: entirely custom ship with textures graciously provided by Liqvo! dandy little racing vessel with utterly ridiculous performance
	
### Engines
 - SSE NANI Torch Refit: it's the NANI in a torch slot. Have fun
 - MA-NTR600-II: twin torch, relatively expensive but incredibly efficient for its thrust class
 - RA-TNTRL-R44: quad torch, literally just the K44 RCS thrusters on a torch mount
 - RA-K69V Quad Engine: custom-made quad torch, same as above but it's the K69Vs and they fucking gimbal
 - RMS Pin-M200: super efficient and gimbal like the C50 but requires a comically impractical amount of power

### Thrusters
 - RMS Pin-C50: extremely efficient pulsed induction thruster that has incredible gimbal range and second-to-none wear statistics but has very high power demand

### Power Systems

#### Fission Rods
 - 1x SO6 Fuel Rod: kind of a joke, lowest thermal output of any other reactor in the game

#### Capacitors
 - Light Ultracapacitor: basically a single capacitor from an array
 - ND-iSMB: lighter capacitor that uses SMES tech
 - ND-iSMB Dual Coupling: even lighter capacitor that's just two smaller iSMB units braided together

#### Turbines:
 - Thermocouple Array: uses reactor heat and cold propellant to produce a little power, very Light, best used in conjunction with an MPDG
 - Laminar Turbine: a lighter turbine that produces more power than the base turbine
 - Dual Laminar Turbine: two of them!

#### Auxiliary Power Generators
 - OPG-14 StatPlasma: produces 1400 MW of power
 - MPI City-class MPDG: produces 2000 MW of power, MPI might have made a pact with Satan

#### Auxiliary Power Storage
 - OPS-10 Capacitor Bank: a relatively light, cheap APS that stores 10 MJ and discharges at the same rate as a capacitor

#### Hardpoint Equipment
 - Rusatom-Antonoff Ore Recovery Device: a hardened AR-1500 Manipulator that wears slower than the base model and is stronger
 - RA DMW Cannon: a tight-beam microwave gun with greater range and power than the MWG, but inefficient and power-hungry. Comes in turreted variant that's a lot slower than the PDMWG
 - THI Harvester-class Haul Drones: high-power haul drones that can operate over double the distance of the base version and provide double the effective force, but take significantly more power and need lots of drone components

### MPUs
 - Rusatom-Antonoff MPU Mk2: larger than most others with an increased efficiency compared to the basegame version
 - THI Bulker MPU: squeezes a massive amount of mineral hold space beneath the unit... at the expense of the processing volume, which is comically difficult to load
	
### Cargo Bay Accessories
 - Not usable with the Kitsune, KTA24, Runasimi K37, and base OCP
 - Rasamama RP-25: low-profile ore preprocessor that reduces ice content and recovers a modest amount of remass from chunks in the bay
 - Conlido Internal Storage Rack: low-profile storage module that increases mineral hold space
 - Nakamura Big MT: somewhat bulky ore preprocessor, does the same thing as the RP-25 but faster and less efficient, increases MPU mineral efficiency though
 - THI Mineral Tank Module: bulky storage module that increases mineral hold space and behaves kind of like an ore preprocessor since it's warm
 - SSE Voyager Fabricator: literally just the Voyager RSLS Fabrication Plant but without the mineral processor

### Mineral Hold Kits
 - Both amorphic and divided holds are supported
 - Locking Bolts (amorphic): converts the hold to divided, 1:1 (perfect equivalent)
 - SSE Saddlebags: adds a little mineral hold space
 - Conlido aMorphIV (divided): converts the hold to amorphic, 6:4 (reduces total by 33%)
 - E-Prime Hold Rejoin: adds a generous amount of mineral hold space
 - THI MD-5 (divided): converts the hold to amorphic, 6:5 (reduces total by 17%)
 - Conlido freightReady Hoppers: adds a large amount of mineral hold space

## Installation (Steam)

1. Open your game install directory
2. Create a new folder called "mods"
3. Place the .zip you downloaded into it (don't extract it!)
4. Right-click on your game install in Steam, select Properties...
5. Put --enable-mods in the LAUNCH OPTIONS box at the bottom of the popup, in the General tab
6. Run dV!
