SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150|RMS Pin-C50 thruster

SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions Pin-C50 is a unique solid-state thruster system that utilises pulsed induction to accelerate and vector hydrogen plasma without the need for any mechanical components, massively minimising the damage-related issues associated with conventional thrusters. \n\nWhile incredibly hard-wearing, the installation of heavy plasma conduits and supporting power infrastructure, as well as the thrusters' direct embedment into the vessel hull, requires specialist assistance that may be difficult to afford.

SYSTEM_THRUSTER_BLAST|ERS-BlasTR 7200

SYSTEM_THRUSTER_BLAST_DESC|Electro Ride Systems' BlasTR is a complete deviation from their previous NAGHET, utilising a helical magnetoplasmadynamic accelerator to achieve spectacular thrust at equally improbable exhaust velocities. Primarily marketed towards racing ships, it has also seen interest from operators of heavy vessels, whose high thrust requirements have long been overserved by thrusters with poor propellant economies.
