SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150|RMS Pin-C50 thruster

SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions Pin-C50 is a unique solid-state thruster system that utilises pulsed induction to accelerate and vector hydrogen plasma without the need for any mechanical components, massively minimising the damage-related issues associated with conventional thrusters. \n\nWhile incredibly hard-wearing, the installation of heavy plasma conduits and supporting power infrastructure, as well as the thrusters' direct embedment into the vessel hull, requires specialist assistance that may be difficult to afford.
