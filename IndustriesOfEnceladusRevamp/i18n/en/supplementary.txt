SYSTEM_EXSTORAGE_ALT|THI Cargo Container (Alternate)

SYSTEM_EXSTORAGE_ALT_DESC|The Titan Heavy Industries Cargo Containers are fully autonomous storage pods that can relay processed minerals from a mining site. When the cradle is powered down, the pod will return to the designated station. These require on-site mineral processing units to utilize. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nStation control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor.
