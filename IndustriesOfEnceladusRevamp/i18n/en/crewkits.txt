SYSTEM_CREW_ADD_BUNK|Conlido bunkX1

SYSTEM_CREW_ADD_BUNK_DESC|The simplest and cheapest crew accommodation expansion kit money can buy, this set includes two surface-mounted mixed-g beds that implement a memory foam base with basic textile covers and fire-safe insulation. It's surprisingly comfortable, but the lack of further adjustments to the habitat can make some vessels feel crowded. \n\nStation control reminds captains that regulations require at least 3x the allotted provisions for each crewmember over the planned length of excursions into the rings. Failure to do so may result in fines from appropriate regulatory bodies.

It includes a shared multi-channel entertainment system for crew quarters, a partitioned refrigerator and improved food preparation unit for the galley, and several adjustments to the washroom such as a multi-mode showerhead and memory foam toilet cushioning. \n\nNote: showerhead mister is not appropriate for zero-g usage. For best results, do not wash surfaces or cushions with bleach-based cleaners.
