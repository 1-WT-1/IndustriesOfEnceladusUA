SYSTEM_SALVAGE_ARM_HEAVY|Rusatom-Antonoff Ore Recovery Device

SYSTEM_SALVAGE_ARM_HEAVY_DESC|Through the course of their collaboration on the KTA24, Rusatom-Antonoff quickly recognised the shortcomings of the Triskellion-Armstrong AR-1500. A slow and delicate device, its usage as an ore recovery tool quickly wears out its precision servos and carefully-constructed docking adapter. The ORD is their response to such shortcomings. \n\nWhile especially heavy and power-hungry on account of its bulky support structure, its hard-wearing motors and bearings offer a viable and durable alternative to its counterpart.
