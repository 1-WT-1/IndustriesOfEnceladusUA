SYSTEM_DND_HARVHAUL|THI Harvester-class Haul Drones

SYSTEM_DND_HARVHAUL_DESC|This monstrous piece of hardware is an industrial assembly line masquerading as a disposable nanodrone assembler. Its enormous infrared laser array and fabrication unit have be connected to individual low-stress buses, but when it has enough power, it's a thing to behold. The unit's behaviour guides drones to intercept any high-albedo objects and tows them towards your ship.
