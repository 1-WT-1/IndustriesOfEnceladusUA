SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_NANI|SSE NANI Torch Refit

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_NANI_DESC|This comically impractical and completely disgusting main torch is the ultimate logical conclusion of many a night spent drinking and ruminating on life's purpose. Coming to the determination that there isn't one, the team at Sin Space Engineering put their heads together and produced this thing. \n\nDisclaimer: Omaewamou-Shindeiru thinks this is really funny and fully endorses the NANI's use as a propulsion solution. May void vessel warranty. Usage as main torch in some vessels may damage your reactor.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_NANI_SPECS|Thrust: 3,450 kN \nExhaust velocity: 132 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 0.5 kg/s \nPower consumption: 200 MW \nThermal consumption: 2 GW \nPropellant: Supercritical liquid uranium salt \nBurn time: 1 minute (est) \nMass: 10,000 kg \nManufacturer: Sin Space Engineering / Omaewamou-Shindeiru


SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_GEMINI|MA-NTR600-II dual engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_GEMINI_DESC|The NTR600-II, otherwise known as the "Gemini", is a dual-mounted magnetoplasmadynamic torch unit capable of delivering decent thrust with excellent efficiency and reliability. \n\nDisclaimer: maintenance of this unit is to be performed only by Mitsudaya-Starbus engineers or licensed sub-contractors. Insurance plans are not yet available in the outer solar system.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_GEMINI_SPECS|Thrust: 1,200 kN \nExhaust velocity: 28 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 52 kg/s \nPower consumption: 250 MW \nThermal consumption: 16.8 GW \nOperation mode: Variable thrust \nPropellant: Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 4,350 kg \nManufacturer: Mitsudaya-Starbus


SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_SOYUZ|RA-TNTRL-R44 quad engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_SOYUZ_DESC|It's by no stretch of the imagination that this "torch" exists. Rusatom-Antonoff aimed to compete with other multiple-torch assemblies by introducing their own, but development was slow, and by the end of the 22nd century, many prototypes had been tried and failed with no viable solutions. \n\nMyths of its invention process vary, but generally suggest that the lead designer on the project was visited in a dream by the ghost of legendary Soviet rocket engineer Valentin Glushko. He spoke one word, 'Soyuz', and then departed, leaving the K44 RCS thruster at the designer's feet. \n\nProduction of these combined units continues to this day, and is part of the reason why the K44 thruster is still so abundant.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_SOYUZ_SPECS|Thrust: 1,600 kN \nExhaust velocity: 15 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 106.4 kg/s \nPower consumption: 60 MW \nThermal consumption: 12.0 GW \nOperation mode: Pulsed thrust \nPropellant: Oxygen-Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 650 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom-Antonoff


SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_THUNDER|RA-K69V quad engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_THUNDER_DESC|This torch is a custom-engineered piece of equipment that takes the frame of an R44 and replaces its engines with K69V thrusters, complete with the gimbal mountings the line is so famous for among ringside racers. Installation comes with optional and entirely legal "Thunderbarge-class" transponder modification.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_THUNDER_SPECS|Thrust: 1,600 kN \nExhaust velocity: 12 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 133.2 kg/s \nPower consumption: 100 MW \nThermal consumption: 14.4 GW \nOperation mode: Pulsed thrust, gimballed \nGimbal angle: 25 deg \nGimbal speed: 360 deg/s \nPropellant: Oxygen-Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 950 kg \nManufacturer: Custom-built / Rusatom-Antonoff


SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PIN1200|RMS Pin-M200 engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PIN1200_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions Pin-M200 implements the same pulsed induction technology that powers its Pin-150 series of solid-state RCS thrusters on a larger scale. It produces phenomenal thrust with remarkable efficiency, but its truly enormous power requirements make it an impractical choice for most nuclear thermal rockets.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_PIN1200_SPECS|Thrust: 1,200 kN \nExhaust velocity: 105 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 11.4 kg/s \nPower consumption: 510 MW \nOperation mode: Virtual variable thrust, gimballed \nGimbal angle: 36 deg \nGimbal speed: instantaneous \nPropellant: Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 2,650 kg \nManufacturer: Rasamama Material Solutions


SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_CRACK|NDDFD engine

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_CRACK_DESC|The Directed Fusion Detonation engine by Nakamura Dynamics is one of the most powerful - and earliest! - fusion propulsion solutions still on the market. Popularised by a now-infamous 2214 advertisement backed by the Vengaboys' "Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom", the NDDFD utilises powerful electromagnets to crush remass-heated ferromagnetic shells containing pressurised deuterium and tritium, then direct the resultant detonation out of its cage-like nozzle assembly.

SYSTEM_MAIN_ENGINE_CRACK_SPECS|Thrust: 1,800 kN \nExhaust velocity: 1,850 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 1 kg/s \nPower consumption: 220 MJ \nOperation mode: Pulsed thrust \n Propellant: Hydrogen plasma \nFusion fuel: D-T \nBurn time: 30 minutes (est) \nMass: 4,650 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics


------ THRUSTERS
SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150|RMS Pin-C50 thruster

SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions Pin-C50 is a unique solid-state thruster system that utilises pulsed induction to accelerate and vector hydrogen plasma without the need for any mechanical components, massively minimising the damage-related issues associated with conventional thrusters. \n\nWhile incredibly hard-wearing, the installation of heavy plasma conduits and supporting power infrastructure, as well as the thrusters' direct embedment into the vessel hull, requires specialist assistance that may be difficult to afford.

SYSTEM_THRUSTER_PIN150_SPECS|Thrust: 150 kN \nExhaust velocity: 90 km/s \nPropellant consumption: 1.6 kg/s \nPower consumption: 75 MW \nOperation mode: Virtual variable thrust, gimballed \nGimbal angle: 36 deg \nGimbal speed: instantaneous \nPropellant: Hydrogen plasma \nMass: 135 kg (per thruster) \nManufacturer: Rasamama Material Solutions



------ TOOLS ------
SYSTEM_SALVAGE_ARM_HEAVY|Rusatom-Antonoff Ore Recovery Device

SYSTEM_SALVAGE_ARM_HEAVY_DESC|Through the course of their collaboration on the KTA24, Rusatom-Antonoff quickly recognised the shortcomings of the Triskellion-Armstrong AR-1500. A slow and delicate device, its usage as an ore recovery tool quickly wears out its precision servos and carefully-constructed docking adapter. The ORD is their response to such shortcomings. \n\nWhile especially heavy and power-hungry on account of its bulky support structure, its hard-wearing motors and bearings offer a viable and durable alternative to its counterpart. 

SYSTEM_SALVAGE_ARM_HEAVY_SPECS|Arm strength: 3,200 kN \n Reach: 40 m \n Power draw (peak): 220 MW \n Mounting Location: High-stress only \nMass: 14,000 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom-Antonoff


SYSTEM_EXODYN|THI Dyna-Cargo Container

SYSTEM_EXODYN_DESC|An experimental dynamic variant of the THI Cargo Container, released to the public in the mid-2200s. Requires on-site mineral processing units to utilise. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nDyna-Cargo is a trademark of Titan Heavy Industries.

SYSTEM_EXSTORAGE_ALT|THI Cargo Container (Alternate)

SYSTEM_EXSTORAGE_ALT_DESC|The Titan Heavy Industries Cargo Containers are fully autonomous storage pods that can relay processed minerals from a mining site. When the cradle is powered down, the pod will return to the designated station. These require on-site mineral processing units to utilize. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nStation control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor. Captains assume all such liability. \n\nThis alternate version for the Prospector series is placed at the midships for enhanced manoeuvring.

SYSTEM_EXMONO_ALT|THI Monocargo Container (Alternate)

SYSTEM_EXMONO_ALT_DESC|A single-ore variant of the standard THI Cargo Container for specialized mining runs that focus on the collection of only one mineral type. These require on-site mineral processing units to utilize. The equipment purchase of the cargo cradle comes with a lease covering the resupply of new pods for as long as the owner holds the license. \n\nStation control warns that retrofit with certain RCS configurations may risk overheating the Cargo Container's micro-reactor.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_FURN|Rusatom-Antonoff MPU Mk2

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_FURN_DESC|This Mark-2 variant of the Rusatom-Antonoff Mineral Processing Unit, affectionately termed "the Gulper" by ringside miners, combines the best qualities of its predecessor with an inlet cuff and additional heating elements, increasing overall efficiency and reclamation yields at the cost of decreased operational reach.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_FURN_SPECS|Processing capacity: 25 kg/s \nPower draw: 25 MW / chunk \nMineral processing efficiency: 60% \nRemass processing efficiency: 40% \nMass: 3,000 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom-Antonoff



SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_BULK|THI Bulker MPU

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_BULK_DESC|The Titan Heavy Industries "Bulker" MPU was introduced to the market in the mid-2200s, but has only seen distribution among Enceladian miners following trade agreements in the 2260s. Its simple design is a classic example of THI's "less is more" approach to engineering. \n\nHeavy and awkward to load compared to other MPUs, what makes the Bulker unique is its inbuilt storage capacity. The internals of a THI-CC drone have been incorporated beneath the processing area; while the bins have been reduced in size, they can still dramatically increase the mineral capacity of any vessel they're installed in.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_BULK_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 10,000 kg / mineral (60,000 kg total) \nProcessing capacity: 40 kg/s \nPower draw: 100 MW / chunk \nMineral processing efficiency: 70% \nRemass processing efficiency: 20% \nMass: 8,000 kg \nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_4K|Conlido Internal Storage Rack

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_4K_DESC|The Conlido RVM Internal Storage Rack, tried and tested by asteroid belt miners throughout the early 22nd century, is a relatively simple concept with a complicated execution. This modular retrofit kit allows for existing units to be attached to the processed material lines of most large vessels available on the ringside market.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_4K_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 4,000 kg / mineral (24,000 kg total) \nMass: 3,000 kg \nManufacturer: Conlido RVM


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_8K|THI Mineral Tank Module

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_8K_DESC|Titan Heavy Industries' internal storage solution is as experimental as it is novel. By tapping reactor heat from the vessel's radiators, processed materials can be held in a liquid state indefinitely, increasing storage efficiency by up to 20%. \n\nSome miners have taken to using the unit as a rudimentary ore preprocessor, as the relatively thin insulation bleeds heat into the space between the tanks. THI does not endorse nor recommend usage in this manner.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_8K_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 8,000kg / mineral (48,000 kg total) \nIce melt rate: 5 kg/s \nPower draw: 250 KW / chunk (heating losses) \n Remass processing efficiency: 10% \nMass: 8,000 kg \nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_MANUAL|Requires an MPU to properly utilise. \nPassively increases onboard processed cargo volume. \nProcessed ore stored in seperate containers, with capacity limited per mineral type. \nTakes up some space in the cargo bay. \nDoes not require power or reactor heat.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_MANUAL|Requires an MPU to properly utilise. \nPassively increases onboard processed cargo volume. \nProcessed ore stored in seperate containers, with capacity limited per mineral type. \nReduces ice mass of chunks within a small area. \nTakes up some space in the cargo bay.

------ AUX PREPROCESSORS

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_0x30|Rasamama RP-25

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_0x30_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions RP-25 is a low-profile ore preprocessor designed to melt ice from mineral chunks within a vessel's cargo bay. The unit taps the reactor turbine bleed line for thermal power and requires very little electrical energy to function. \n\nRemass is recovered by running process exhaust through a condenser panel on the vessel's outer hull. Rasamama MS recommends monthly flow tests followed by hot gas purges to prevent fouling.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_0x30_SPECS|Ice melt rate: 10 kg/s \nPower draw: 25 KW / chunk \nMPU mineral efficiency: x100% (no change) \nRemass processing efficiency: 30% \nMass: 750 kg \nManufacturer: Rasamama Material Solutions


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_20x10|Nakamura Big MT

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_20x10_DESC|Nakamura Dynamics' Big MT Ore Preprocessor utilises the fundamental principles of its operation to its advantage when processing ore chunks. Free steam in the cargo bay is superheated by the unit's massive toroidal radiator, quickly ablating ice it comes into contact with and preheating the ore within them for more efficient processing. \n\nWhile some process steam can be reclaimed as propellant, its high temperature means that a significant amount is lost to its condenser vents.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_20x10_SPECS|Ice melt rate: 25 kg/s \nPower draw: 125 KW / chunk \nMPU mineral efficiency: x120% \nRemass processing efficiency: 10% \nMass: 2,000 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_MANUAL|Reduces ice mass of chunks within a large area. \nReplenishes propellant. \nIncreases MPU efficiency multiplicatively. \nLarger cargo holds have greater processing reach. \nProcesses multiple ore chunks simultaneously. \nPower requirements and processing speed listed per chunk. \nDoes not extract minerals or destroy chunks.

--- AUX FABRICATOR

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB|SSE Voyager Fabricator

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB_DESC|A custom-made and completely unlicensed monstrosity from Sin Space Engineering that became popular among ringside miners in the 2260s. The fabricator unit of a Voyager RSLS MPU has been torn out and placed further up in the cargo bay, along with a small mineral storage volume to replace its specialised feed hoppers. \n\nDue to the replacement of its power bus with a lower-grade distributor, moderate power efficiency losses are to be expected over the standard unit. \n\nDisclaimer: Nakamura Dynamics does not provide a warranty for this unit, and does not recognise it as part of its range of products, express or implied. Use of modified equipment may incur damages and present unexpected hazards.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_FAB_SPECS|Print power draw: 120 MW \nPrinting capability: drones, ammunition \nCargo capacity: 2,000 kg / mineral (12,000 kg total) \nMass: 5,000 kg \nManufacturer: Sin Space Engineering / Nakamura-Obonto
