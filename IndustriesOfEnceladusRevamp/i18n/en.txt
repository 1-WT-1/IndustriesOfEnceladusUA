SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_FURN|Rusatom-Antonoff MPU Mk2

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_FURN_DESC|This Mark-2 variant of the Rusatom-Antonoff Mineral Processing Unit, affectionately termed "the Gulper" by ringside miners, combines the best qualities of its predecessor with an inlet cuff and additional heating elements, increasing overall efficiency and reclamation yields at the cost of decreased operational reach.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_FURN_SPECS|Processing capacity: 25 kg/s \nPower draw: 25 MW / chunk \nMineral processing efficiency: 60% \nRemass processing efficiency: 40% \nMass: 3,000 kg \nManufacturer: Rusatom-Antonoff



SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_BULK|THI Bulker MPU

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_BULK_DESC|The Titan Heavy Industries "Bulker" MPU was introduced to the market in the mid-2200s, but has only seen distribution among Enceladian miners following trade agreements in the 2260s. Its simple design is a classic example of THI's "less is more" approach to engineering. \n\nHeavy and awkward to load compared to other MPUs, what makes the Bulker unique is its inbuilt storage capacity. The internals of a THI-CC drone have been incorporated beneath the processing area; while the bins have been reduced in size, they can still dramatically increase the mineral capacity of any vessel they're installed in.

SYSTEM_CARGO_MPU_BULK_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 10,000 kg / mineral (60,000 kg total) \nProcessing capacity: 40 kg/s \nPower draw: 100 MW / chunk \nMineral processing efficiency: 70% \nRemass processing efficiency: 20% \nMass: 8,000 kg \nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_4K|Conlido Internal Storage Rack

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_4K_DESC|The Conlido RVM Internal Storage Rack, tried and tested by asteroid belt miners throughout the early 22nd century, is a relatively simple concept with a complicated execution. This modular retrofit kit allows for existing units to be attached to the processed material lines of most large vessels available on the ringside market.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_4K_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 4,000 kg / mineral (24,000 kg total) \nMass: 3,000 kg \nManufacturer: Conlido RVM


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_8K|THI Mineral Tank Module

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_8K_DESC|Titan Heavy Industries' internal storage solution is as experimental as it is novel. By tapping reactor heat from the vessel's radiators, processed materials can be held in a liquid state indefinitely, increasing storage efficiency by up to 20%. \n\nSome miners have taken to using the unit as a rudimentary ore preprocessor, as the relatively thin insulation bleeds heat into the space between the tanks. THI does not endorse nor recommend usage in this manner.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_8K_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 8,000kg / mineral (48,000 kg total) \nIce melt rate: 5 kg/s \nPower draw: 250 KW / chunk (heating losses) \n Remass processing efficiency: 10% \nMass: 8,000 kg \nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORAGE_MANUAL|Requires an MPU to properly utilise. \nPassively increases onboard processed cargo volume. \nProcessed ore stored in seperate containers, with capacity limited per mineral type. \nTakes up some space in the cargo bay. \nDoes not require power or reactor heat.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_STORPROC_MANUAL|Requires an MPU to properly utilise. \nPassively increases onboard processed cargo volume. \nProcessed ore stored in seperate containers, with capacity limited per mineral type. \nReduces ice mass of chunks within a small area. \nTakes up some space in the cargo bay.



SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_0x30|Rasamama RP-25

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_0x30_DESC|The Rasamama Material Solutions RP-25 is a low-profile ore preprocessor designed to melt ice from mineral chunks within a vessel's cargo bay. The unit taps the reactor turbine bleed line for thermal power and requires very little electrical energy to function. \n\nRemass is recovered by running process exhaust through a condenser panel on the vessel's outer hull. Rasamama MS recommends monthly flow tests followed by hot gas purges to prevent fouling.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_0x30_SPECS|Ice melt rate: 10 kg/s \nPower draw: 25 KW / chunk \nMPU mineral efficiency: x100% (no change) \nRemass processing efficiency: 30% \nMass: 750 kg \nManufacturer: Rasamama Material Solutions


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_20x10|Nakamura Big MT

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_20x10_DESC|Nakamura Dynamics' Big MT Ore Preprocessor utilises the fundamental principles of its operation to its advantage when processing ore chunks. Free steam in the cargo bay is superheated by the unit's massive toroidal radiator, quickly ablating ice it comes into contact with and preheating the ore within them for more efficient processing. \n\nWhile some process steam can be reclaimed as propellant, its high temperature means that a significant amount is lost to its condenser vents.

SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_20x10_SPECS|Ice melt rate: 25 kg/s \nPower draw: 125 KW / chunk \nMPU mineral efficiency: x120% \nRemass processing efficiency: 10% \nMass: 2,000 kg \nManufacturer: Nakamura Dynamics


SYSTEM_CARGO_AUX_PREPROC_MANUAL|Reduces ice mass of chunks within a large area. \nReplenishes propellant. \nIncreases MPU efficiency multiplicatively. \nLarger cargo holds have greater processing reach. \nProcesses multiple ore chunks simultaneously. \nPower requirements and processing speed listed per chunk. \nDoes not extract minerals or destroy chunks.
